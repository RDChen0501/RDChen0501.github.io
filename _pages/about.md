Hi, I am a 2nd-year Masters of Computer Science (MsCS) student at Carnegie Mellon Institue. I do robotics research at the Robotics Institue adviced by Andrea Bajcsy.

My research focus on dealing with uncertainty in the generalist robotics pipeline 
and improving robot perception with additional modalities.

My goal is to build embodied agents that act robustly and naturally in human environments by eliminating avoidable uncertainty through new modalities and identify unavoidable uncertainty through uncertainty quantification. 


I am passionate about teaching robots new human-like skills or refine the percision of the ones they possess by leveraging new modalities. 
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
